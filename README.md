# NEBS-IT (nebs-it)

A modern HR/employee management front-end built with Vite + React and Tailwind CSS.

## Overview

NEBS-IT Dashboard is a modern HR and employee management front-end application developed using Vite, React, and Tailwind CSS. The project focuses on building a clean, responsive, and scalable UI for managing organizational workflows such as employee information, attendance, payroll, and internal notices.

A key feature of this application is the **Notice Management module**, where administrators can create, publish, and manage notices through an intuitive interface. The system includes form validation, notice type selection, status control (published/unpublished), and paginated notice listings, all integrated with backend APIs.

The application follows a modular architecture with reusable components, centralized API handling, protected routes, and state management, ensuring maintainability and performance. It is designed to easily scale as additional HR features are introduced.
